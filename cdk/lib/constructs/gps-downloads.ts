   * Written out in full rather than assembled from an "owner/repo" string,
   * because the shape of this claim is NOT what you would guess.
   *
   * DO NOT WRITE `repo:<owner>/<repo>:*` FROM MEMORY. GitHub now issues an
   * IMMUTABLE subject that embeds the numeric owner and repo ids:
   *
   *   repo:GeoSpoof@320249603/geospoof-gps@1291874641:ref:refs/tags/gps-v0.2.2
   *
   * Repos created after 2026-07-15, and any repo RENAMED OR TRANSFERRED after
   * that date, use this format; older untouched repos keep the classic
   * name-based one until opted in. Transferring geospoof-gps to the GeoSpoof
   * org flipped it, and a name-based policy silently stopped matching - the
   * failure is an unassumable role at publish time, long after the build.
   *
   * Get the current value from the repo itself rather than reconstructing it:
   *
   *   gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/oidc/customization/sub \
   *     --jq .sub_claim_prefix
   *
   * The owner segment is wildcarded here so a future transfer needs no change
   * (a transfer alters the owner id, never the repo id). That is safe WITHOUT
   * any `repository_id` condition precisely because the immutable subject
   * embeds the repo id: only tokens minted for repo 1291874641 can match, and
   * repo ids are globally unique and never reused. Which matters, because AWS
   * has only reliably honored `sub` and `aud` from GitHub tokens, so a policy
   * leaning on a custom `repository_id` claim risks denying every publish.
   *
   * A LIST because a format migration or an owner move can need two entries
   * trusted at once; keep it at one whenever nothing is in flight.
