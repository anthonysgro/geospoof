# Privacy Policy for GeoSpoof

**Last Updated:** June 20, 2026

## Overview

GeoSpoof is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension is designed to enhance your location privacy and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to the extension developer.

**GeoSpoof does not implement VPN functionality.** It does not use NetworkExtension or any VPN framework, and it does not route, tunnel, or inspect network traffic. The word "VPN" appears only in reference to the optional "Sync with VPN" feature, which helps align your browser's reported location with the exit region of a third-party VPN you are already running.

## Data Collection

**GeoSpoof does not collect any personal data.** The extension:

- Does NOT track your browsing activity
- Does NOT collect analytics or telemetry
- Does NOT store data on external servers
- Does NOT share data with third parties for advertising or marketing

## Local Data Storage

All extension settings are stored locally on your device using the browser's local storage API (`browser.storage.local`):

- Your spoofed location coordinates
- Your timezone preferences
- Resolved location name (city, country)
- WebRTC protection settings
- VPN sync preference
- Onboarding completion status

This data never leaves your device and is only accessible by the extension.

## Third-Party API Usage

When you use certain features, GeoSpoof communicates with external services. Both
the Safari extension and the companion app (iOS, iPadOS, macOS) may make these
requests, depending on which surface you're using. With one exception, the
developer operates no server and receives none of this data, and all such HTTPS
requests go directly from your device to the third party (the STUN requests below
are direct UDP from your device). **The exception is the timezone boundary data
(section 2 below), which the extension fetches from the developer's own domain,
`geospoof.com`.** See that section for what that means for your IP address.

### 1. Location / place name resolution

**[Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/) (OpenStreetMap)** — _Extension only._
Used when you search for a city or the extension performs reverse geocoding.
Sends your search query (city name) or coordinates over HTTPS.
[OpenStreetMap Privacy Policy](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy)

**Apple geocoding (`CLGeocoder`)** — _Companion app only._ When you set a manual
location in the app, it uses Apple's on-device geocoding service to resolve the
precise IANA timezone for the chosen coordinates. This is an Apple system API; if
it returns nothing (offline), the app falls back to bundled offline boundary data
and never leaves the device. City search in the app is fully offline (a bundled
catalog) and makes no network request.

### 2. Timezone boundary data

**[browser-geo-tz](https://github.com/kevmo314/browser-geo-tz) data, served from
`geospoof.com`** — _Extension only._ To resolve the correct IANA timezone (e.g.
`America/New_York`) for a location, the extension makes HTTPS range requests to
**`geospoof.com`** to download small chunks of geographic boundary data, then
performs the lookup locally on your device. This data is hosted on the
developer's own domain (a static-file host, Vercel) rather than a third-party
CDN — the previously used public CDN truncated the dataset, which silently broke
timezone resolution.

**What hosting it ourselves means for your privacy:** because the request goes to
developer-controlled infrastructure, it carries your IP address (your real IP,
unless you are behind a VPN) like any ordinary web request, plus the specific
byte ranges requested. Those byte ranges correspond to the geographic region
being looked up, so the request can reveal your _approximate_ spoofed region.
Your coordinates are never sent as an explicit query. The developer does **not**
use these requests for analytics, tracking, profiling, advertising, or user
accounts, and stores no personal data from them; standard web-server logs may
record the request (IP, timestamp, requested path) transiently. The IP is
processed only to deliver the requested file. The boundary data is cached by your
browser for a long period, so after the first lookups the extension rarely needs
to request it again. (The companion app instead ships this boundary data inside
the app and resolves timezones entirely offline, making no network request.)

### 3. VPN Sync (optional — only when you enable "Sync with VPN")

This feature never runs unless you have explicitly turned on "Sync with VPN" (or
tap "Re-sync"). It works in two steps — detect your current public (VPN exit) IP,
then look up the approximate region of that IP. **Only your public IP is
transmitted — no identifiers, account data, or browsing history.**

**Step 1 — public IP detection:**

- _Extension:_ tries, in order with failover, **AWS** (`checkip.amazonaws.com`),
  **Cloudflare** (`www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace`), **Akamai**
  (`whatismyip.akamai.com`), and **[ipify](https://www.ipify.org/)**
  (`api.ipify.org`). Each simply returns your public-facing IP.
- _Companion app:_ uses **STUN** (a single UDP request) to **Cloudflare**
  (`stun.cloudflare.com`) and **Google** (`stun.l.google.com`) to discover the
  public IP, falling back to **ipify** (`api.ipify.org`) over HTTPS if STUN is
  blocked. STUN servers receive only the network request needed to report your
  public IP back to you.

**Step 2 — IP geolocation** (both extension and app), sent in parallel; first
successful response wins, the rest are cancelled:

- **[GeoJS](https://www.geojs.io/)** (`get.geojs.io`) — primary.
- **[FreeIPAPI](https://freeipapi.com/)** (`free.freeipapi.com`) — fallback.
  ([Privacy Policy](https://freeipapi.com/privacy-policy))
- **[ReallyFreeGeoIP](https://reallyfreegeoip.org/)** (`reallyfreegeoip.org`) — fallback.
- **[ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/)** (`ipinfo.io`) — fallback.
  ([Privacy Policy](https://ipinfo.io/privacy-policy))

**Purpose:** to determine the geographic region of your VPN exit server so
GeoSpoof can set your spoofed location to match your VPN.

**Privacy safeguards:**

- All HTTPS requests are encrypted; STUN is a direct UDP round-trip to discover
  your IP.
- Your IP address is **never persisted to disk**. It is held only in an
  in-memory / session cache for the duration of your browser (or app) session.
- That cache is **cleared** when you disable VPN sync or switch to a different
  location input method.

> The IP these services see is typically your **VPN exit IP** (a shared address),
> not your home IP, because the whole point of the feature is that a VPN is
> already active.

## In-App Purchases and Subscriptions

The iOS, iPadOS, and macOS app offers paid features through Apple's In-App Purchase system:

- **GeoSpoof Pro** — an auto-renewable subscription (monthly or annual) that unlocks Pro features such as automatic background VPN sync, per-site allowlist/denylist rules, Home Screen and Control Center widgets, custom accuracy, and the on-map location picker. The subscription renews automatically until cancelled; you can manage or cancel it anytime in your Apple Account settings. A free, fully functional tier remains available without any purchase.
- **Tips** — optional one-time purchases that let you support development and unlock no features or functionality.

**All payments are processed by Apple via In-App Purchase. The developer never receives your payment details, card information, Apple Account identifier, or any personal data from a purchase or subscription.** Billing, receipts, renewals, and refunds are handled entirely by Apple under its terms. That payment processing is governed by Apple's own privacy policy, and Apple acts as an independent data controller for it.

**How your Pro status is determined.** Your entitlement — whether you are a subscriber or a grandfathered "founding" user — is resolved entirely on your device using Apple's StoreKit framework. Founder status is derived from your App Store purchase history (the original app version your Apple Account first downloaded) via StoreKit's `AppTransaction`; this needs no account, no sign-in, and no developer backend, and is read directly from Apple on-device. The resolved status is cached locally on your device only and is **never transmitted to the developer** — there is no developer-side record of who is or isn't a subscriber, and GeoSpoof maintains no user accounts.

## Permissions Explained

The extension requires the following permissions. Exact permissions vary slightly by browser (some APIs do not exist on every engine), but the principles below apply everywhere.

- **storage**: To save your settings locally on your device
- **privacy** (Firefox/Chromium only): To configure WebRTC protection settings
- **proxy** (Firefox/Chromium only): To detect when a browser-based VPN switches exit nodes so VPN Sync can re-align your spoofed location. GeoSpoof only _observes_ proxy changes — it never sets or routes a proxy.
- **scripting**: To inject the location-spoofing overrides into pages
- **alarms**: To run periodic health checks that keep the spoofing overrides active
- **idle** (Firefox/Chromium only): Part of the VPN-sync re-check scheduling
- **`<all_urls>` / host access to all websites**: To inject location spoofing on every website you visit
- **webRequest permissions** (Firefox only): To repair the timezone leak inside Web Workers at the network layer

These permissions are used solely for the extension's functionality and not for data collection.

### Why Safari warns that GeoSpoof can "read and alter webpages"

When you enable GeoSpoof, Safari shows a prompt similar to:

> "The extension 'GeoSpoof' would like to access [websites]. This extension will be able to read and alter webpages and see your browsing history on these websites. This could include sensitive information, including passwords, phone numbers, and credit cards."

**This warning is standard for any extension that runs on every site, and the specific websites Safari names are simply the tabs you happen to have open at that moment — GeoSpoof does not single them out and has no special interest in them.** Safari shows this same wording for ad blockers, password managers, and dark-mode extensions.

GeoSpoof needs broad website access because its only job is to make every site you visit see your chosen location instead of your real one. To do that it must run a small script on each page that overrides the browser's location, timezone, and date APIs _before_ the page's own code runs. There is no narrower permission that would let it spoof location site-wide.

**What "read and alter webpages" technically allows vs. what GeoSpoof actually does:**

| Safari says it _could_                                             | What GeoSpoof _actually_ does                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read page content (including passwords, form fields, credit cards) | Never reads form fields, passwords, page text, or any page content. The overrides only replace location/time API return values.                                            |
| Alter webpages                                                     | Only "alters" the values returned by the Geolocation, `Date`, `Intl`, and Temporal APIs. It does not modify page text, inject ads, or rewrite content.                     |
| See your browsing history                                          | Never reads, stores, or transmits your history or the list of sites you visit.                                                                                             |
| Transmit data externally                                           | Sends nothing to the developer. The only outbound requests are the optional geocoding / VPN-sync API calls described above, and only when you actively use those features. |

The extension is open source, so you can verify all of the above:

**Which Safari permission option should you choose?**

- **Allow for One Day** — best for trying GeoSpoof out. Access expires automatically, so it's the lowest-commitment option.
- **Always Allow on Every Website** — most convenient if you want location protection everywhere without re-granting access.
- **Allow / Always Allow on specific websites** — if you only want spoofing on certain sites, grant access per-site and leave the rest unprotected.
- **Deny** — GeoSpoof will not run on that site (it cannot spoof your location there).

You can change or revoke any of these at any time in **Safari → Settings → Extensions → GeoSpoof**, or per-site from the **AA** menu in the address bar on iOS/iPadOS. Restricting access never deletes your settings — it only controls where spoofing is allowed to run.

## Data Security

- All settings are stored locally using the browser's secure storage API
- No data is transmitted to the developer for collection, analytics, or profiling
- The one request that reaches developer-controlled infrastructure — fetching timezone boundary data from `geospoof.com` — is a static-file download that is not used to track or identify you (see "Third-Party API Usage")
- All third-party API calls use HTTPS encryption
- The developer maintains no user accounts and runs no backend application or database; `geospoof.com` serves only static files (the website and the timezone boundary data)

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

- All settings can be cleared by disabling or removing the extension
- You can view all stored data in your browser's extension storage inspector
- No account or registration is required

## For Users in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland

If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, the following applies to you in addition to the rest of this policy.

**Controller:** Anthony Sgro, an individual developer based in the United States, acts as the data controller for any personal data processed by this extension. You can contact the controller at [support@geospoof.com](mailto:support@geospoof.com).

**Legal basis for processing:** Two kinds of personal data may be processed, both limited to your public IP address. (1) When you explicitly enable the "Sync with VPN" feature, your public IP is sent to the IP-detection and geolocation services listed above; we rely on your consent (GDPR Art. 6(1)(a)), which you give by enabling the feature and can withdraw at any time by disabling "Sync with VPN" in the extension popup. (2) Whenever the extension resolves a timezone, it fetches boundary data from `geospoof.com`, which — like any web request — transmits your IP to the developer's static-file host; we rely on legitimate interests (GDPR Art. 6(1)(f)) in delivering the boundary data needed for the location-spoofing you requested, and the IP is used only to serve the file and is not retained or otherwise processed. Withdrawing consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

**International transfers:** The third-party services listed above (AWS, Cloudflare, Akamai, ipify, GeoJS, FreeIPAPI, ReallyFreeGeoIP, ipinfo.io, Google STUN, and Nominatim) are operated outside the EEA, including in the United States; each is an independent controller and determines its own transfer mechanisms. Separately, the timezone boundary data is served from the developer's own domain `geospoof.com`, hosted on Vercel, whose infrastructure is also located outside the EEA, including in the United States. When you use features that contact any of these endpoints, your public IP is transferred to that infrastructure. Apart from serving that static boundary data from `geospoof.com`, the extension developer operates no server and performs no other cross-border transfer of its own.

**Your rights under GDPR / UK GDPR:** you have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict, object to, and port your personal data, and to withdraw consent at any time. Because the extension stores no personal data on any server controlled by the developer, most of these rights are exercised directly by you within the extension: uninstalling the extension or disabling "Sync with VPN" fully erases everything the developer could ever access. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

**Retention:** Your public IP is held only in volatile memory for the current browser session and cleared when you disable the feature or close your browser. No retention period applies because no storage occurs.

## For California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), gives you specific rights regarding your personal information.

**We do not sell or share your personal information** as those terms are defined under the CCPA/CPRA. We do not disclose personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising. We do not knowingly handle the personal information of consumers under 16.

**Categories collected:** The only category of personal information touched by the extension is an internet identifier (your public IP address). This happens in two cases: when you enable "Sync with VPN" (sent to the IP-detection and geolocation services), and when the extension fetches timezone boundary data from `geospoof.com` (your IP reaches the developer's static-file host as part of an ordinary web request). In both cases the IP is used only for the purposes described above and is not retained by the developer.

**Your rights:** You have the right to know what personal information is collected, the right to delete personal information, the right to correct inaccurate personal information, the right to opt out of sale or sharing (there is nothing to opt out of here), and the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising these rights. Because no personal information is retained by the developer, these rights are effectively exercised by uninstalling the extension or disabling the feature. For any inquiry, contact [support@geospoof.com](mailto:support@geospoof.com).

## Children's Privacy

GeoSpoof is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has used the extension in a way that caused personal information to reach a third-party service referenced above, please contact us at [support@geospoof.com](mailto:support@geospoof.com) and we will take reasonable steps to assist.

## Security Incidents

Because the extension stores no personal data on any developer-operated server, there is no developer-side database that can be breached. In the unlikely event of a security issue affecting the extension itself (for example, a vulnerability in the extension code), we will publish an advisory on the project's GitHub page and release a patched version through the relevant browser stores. Where required by applicable law, we will notify affected users and the relevant data protection authority.

## Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy changes, the updated version will be posted in the extension's repository and on the GeoSpoof website. The "Last Updated" date will be revised accordingly. Continued use of the extension after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
