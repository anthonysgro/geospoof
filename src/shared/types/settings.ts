   * via the chrome.debugger API (Chrome DevTools Protocol's Emulation domain,
   * `setTimezoneOverride`) instead of the page-world content-script override.
   * The CDP override applies to every frame AND worker — including module /
   * service workers — even on the very first synchronous script, closing the
   * worker-timezone leaks the Chromium content-script path can't cover (no
   * `webRequest.filterResponseData` on Chromium MV3). The trade-off is the
   * persistent "GeoSpoof started debugging this browser" notification bar, so
   * it's strictly opt-in and gated behind the optional `debugger` permission
   * (requested at runtime from the popup). While it's on, only the injected
   * TIMEZONE override is suppressed (redundant); WebRTC protection still runs
   * through the content script. Always false on Firefox/Safari (no
   * chrome.debugger equivalent).
   *
   * GEOLOCATION is deliberately NOT driven through CDP, even in this mode — it
   * stays on the injected content-script path. Reasons:
   *   1. Minimal upside. `navigator.geolocation` is a Window-only API (not
   *      exposed to workers), so the worker-coverage benefit that justifies CDP
   *      for timezone doesn't exist for geolocation. The only edge CDP would buy
   *      is cold start: it could answer the very first `getCurrentPosition` at
   *      native latency instead of after the injected path defers for the
   *      settings round-trip (see `waitForSettings`). But that's a timing-
   *      fidelity nicety, not correctness — the injected deferral already
   *      guarantees no real-location leak at cold start — and it's negated by
   *      reason 2 (early readiness doesn't make geo prompt-free).
   *   2. Real downside. CDP's `setGeolocationOverride` only takes effect once
   *      the origin already holds the geolocation permission, so making it
   *      prompt-free requires `Browser.grantPermissions`, which grants the
   *      origin geolocation while DENYING all its other permissions — clobbering
   *      unrelated site state — and mixes a Browser-domain (global) command into
   *      a per-tab attach, complicating teardown.
   *   3. The injected path is already strictly better here: it replaces
   *      `getCurrentPosition` outright, so it's reliably prompt-free, race-free,
   *      and per-tab scope-aware, with no debugging bar. (See
   *      `Settings.preserveGeolocationPrompt` for opting back into the native
   *      prompt — that's a separate, engine-independent content-script toggle.)
   * The injected geolocation override therefore keeps running in debugger mode;
   * see the timezone-only suppression in background `broadcastSettingsToTabs` /
   * the GET_SETTINGS scoped payload, and `src/background/debugger-spoof.ts`.
