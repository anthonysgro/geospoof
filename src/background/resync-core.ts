/**
 * Shared VPN re-sync gate.
 *
 * Several independent "the network might have just changed" triggers funnel
 * into this one place:
 *   - `proxy.settings.onChange`  (proxy-watcher.ts)  — proxy-API VPNs
 *   - tab navigation / idle→active (activity-watcher.ts) — everything else,
 *     including Firefox onRequest VPNs and OS/desktop VPNs that no browser
 *     event can observe.
 *
 * Centralizing the gate means every trigger shares:
 *   1. one debounce window (coalesces bursts, and lets a VPN exit-node switch
 *      settle before we look),
 *   2. one steady-state minimum-interval floor (so a chatty trigger — rapid
 *      navigation, or a misbehaving VPN — can't drive the rate-limited
 *      IP-detection dependency into block territory),
 *   3. one in-flight guard (overlapping triggers can't race), and
 *   4. one IP-diff check, so the (relatively expensive, rate-limited)
 *      geolocation + apply step only runs when the exit IP actually moved.
 *
 * There is deliberately no interval timer here: an idle browser does zero work.
 * A stale spoofed location only matters when a page reads geolocation, which
 * only happens while the browser is active — which is exactly when the activity
 * triggers fire.

 * is the last line: it only trips on a *total* failure — every IP-echo provider
 * rate-limited (429/403), or a sync that comes back `IP_BLOCKED` (every geo
 * service rejecting this exit IP). In that case we pause the *automatic* path
 * briefly so chatty activity/proxy triggers don't keep re-running the full
 * detect+geo cycle. Kept short (1 min) because it's IP-specific: a VPN switch
 * to a fresh exit IP should resume syncing quickly. (Manual "Sync with VPN" and
