/**
 * Firefox-only `webRequest.filterResponseData` worker script patcher.
 *
 * ## Problem
 *
 * Content scripts cannot inject into Web Worker, SharedWorker, or
 * ServiceWorker contexts. The content-script-level worker-patching
 * module wraps `new Worker(url)` for inline (blob / data) workers by
 * prepending a bootstrap, but URL-based workers, module workers, and
 * service workers all need bytes intercepted at the network layer.
 *
 * ## Solution
 *
 * Firefox still exposes `webRequest.filterResponseData` in MV3, a
 * Chromium-discontinued API that lets an extension pipe the raw bytes
 * of an HTTP response through a transformation. We use it to prepend
 * the timezone spoofing payload to any worker script response, leaving
 * the URL / origin / CSP / import-resolution behaviour untouched — from
 * the browser's perspective nothing unusual happened, it just fetched
 * a script that happens to contain our payload at the top.
 *
 * ## How we identify worker scripts
 *
 * Firefox reports ALL worker script loads (dedicated, shared, service,
 * classic, module) under `details.type === "script"` — the same bucket
 * as every `<script src="...">` on the page. Blindly patching every
 * script would obviously break the web.
 *
 * The reliable distinguisher is the `Sec-Fetch-Dest` HTTP request
 * header, which the browser sets according to the Fetch spec:
 *
 *   - `Sec-Fetch-Dest: worker`        — `new Worker(url)` (classic or module)
 *   - `Sec-Fetch-Dest: sharedworker`  — `new SharedWorker(url)`
 *   - `Sec-Fetch-Dest: serviceworker` — `navigator.serviceWorker.register(url)`
 *   - `Sec-Fetch-Dest: script`        — plain `<script src="...">` tags
 *
 * Headers are available in `onBeforeSendHeaders`, which fires after
 * `onBeforeRequest` but before the request hits the network — and
 * well before any response body arrives. So the classification is
 * always available by the time `filter.ondata` starts firing.
 *
 * ## Two-stage filter flow
 *
 *   1. `onBeforeRequest` — attach a `filterResponseData` filter to
 *      every script request, park state keyed by `requestId`, mark
 *      decision as "pending". This is required because Firefox's
 *      optimized script byte cache only honours filters attached in
 *      `onBeforeRequest`; attaching later silently no-ops for scripts.
 *
 *   2. `onBeforeSendHeaders` — read `Sec-Fetch-Dest`, set the state's
 *      decision to either "patch" (worker / sharedworker /
 *      serviceworker) or "pass" (anything else, including regular
 *      `<script>` tags). Falls back to the URL allowlist (populated
 *      by the content-script `ANNOUNCE_WORKER_FETCH` handshake) when
 *      the header is absent — defensive belt-and-braces.
 *
 *   3. `filter.ondata` / `filter.onstop`
 *      - "patch": buffer all chunks, then emit payload + body + close
 *      - "pass":  write each chunk straight through, close at stop
 *      - "pending" (never arrived): default to pass-through
 *
 * ## Why this replaced the announce-only approach
 *
 * The old design was handshake-only: the injected script fires a
 * CustomEvent → content script → `browser.runtime.sendMessage` →
 * background adds URL to a short-lived allowlist → listener checks
 * allowlist. On a cold MV3 background (post-idle or just-woken), the
 * round-trip could take 50-500ms — and meanwhile `onBeforeRequest`
 * fired synchronously from the worker constructor, found an empty
 * allowlist, and passed the URL through unpatched. Classic race.
 *
 * Moving the signal into `Sec-Fetch-Dest` eliminates the race: the
 * header arrives in the same I/O flow as the request itself, so
 * there's nothing to race against. The allowlist stays in place as
 * a fallback for engines / edge cases where `Sec-Fetch-Dest` is
 * missing (e.g. proxied requests, some redirects).
 *
 * ## Scope of URLs we touch
 *
 * Every http(s) request with `type: "script"`. The filter attaches
 * to all of them but only prepends bytes for the ones tagged as
 * worker-like. Buffer memory is released on `close()` / `disconnect()`.
 *
 * ## Limitations
 *
 *   1. **Subresource Integrity** — Sites that ship `integrity="sha384-..."`
 *      on their worker scripts will fail the hash check after our
 *      modification. The browser refuses to load the worker and the
 *      site's worker-dependent functionality stops working. We catch
 *      the filter-pipeline error in our `onerror` handler and call
 *      `disconnect()` so the original unmodified response falls
 *      through; the site works, the leak remains on that origin.
 *
 *   2. **ServiceWorker persistence** — The browser caches the modified
 *      bytes as the registered SW script. Once registered, it continues
 *      running with our payload until the site updates the script
 *      (byte comparison triggers reinstall, which re-pipes through our
 *      filter) or the user clears site data. Disabling the extension
 *      does not retroactively un-patch already-installed SWs.
 *
 *   3. **Feature detection** — `filterResponseData` may not exist on
 *      every engine. We feature-detect at listener install time and
 *      silently no-op if the API is absent. This also covers Chrome
 *      (polyfill returns undefined), Safari (not implemented), and
 *      future Firefox policy changes.
 *
 *   4. **Source maps** — Prepending shifts line numbers, so dev tools
 *      will show wrong positions when debugging an affected worker.
 *      Doesn't affect end-users, visible to devs only.
 *
 *   5. **Full-response buffering for patched scripts** — We hold the
 *      entire body in memory before writing it back out, because the
 *      payload has to come first. Worker scripts are usually small
 *      (< 1 MB) so the RSS hit is bounded. Pass-through scripts are
 *      streamed chunk-by-chunk with no buffering.

 * and silently skips installation on engines that don't support it
 * (all non-Firefox engines).
 *
 * ## Respawn safety (why listeners register BEFORE any await)
 *
 * MV3 backgrounds are non-persistent: Firefox tears down the event page (and
 * Chromium the service worker) when idle and respawns it on the next event.
 * Only listeners registered SYNCHRONOUSLY during the top-level module run are
 * re-registered on respawn and able to wake the background for their event.
 * If we awaited `loadSettings()` / `browser.tabs.query()` before calling
 * `addListener`, the webRequest listeners would be registered a microtask too
 * late and would be lost on the first idle respawn — which is exactly how
 * URL-based worker patching silently stopped working once the background went
 * idle (the constructor still fired ANNOUNCE_WORKER_FETCH, but no filter was
 * attached). So we register the listeners first, then prime the caches
 * asynchronously; until priming lands the listeners short-circuit on
 * `!cachedSettings` and pass requests through unpatched (the same safe
 * fallback as a cold start). This function must therefore also be invoked
 * synchronously at the top level of the background entry point, not only from
 * `initialize()`.
