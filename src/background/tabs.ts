 * The background is the sole gatekeeper for the per-tab spoofing decision: the
 * `enabled` field is that tab's `Effective_Enabled` value, computed from its
 * top-level URL via the shared `computeEffectiveEnabled` source of truth (Req
 * 8.1, 8.2). The non-scope fields are equal to the persisted Settings (Req
 * 8.3). The allowlist/denylist arrays are never included — `UpdateSettingsPayload`
 * has no list keys, so the lists cannot leak (privacy invariant). One value per
 * tab is sent; `tabs.sendMessage` fans it out to every frame (Req 7.2).
 *
 * Shared by `broadcastSettingsToTabs` (settings/list/mode changes) and the
 * navigation re-evaluation path in `index.ts` (full and same-document/SPA
 * navigations), so both build an identical payload (Req 9.1, 9.2). Returns
 * `true` when the message was delivered, `false` on a send failure (e.g. no
 * content script in the tab yet) or a missing tab id.
